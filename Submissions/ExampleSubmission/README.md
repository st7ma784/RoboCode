# ExampleTank Submission

**Author**: Example Student
**Date**: December 2025
**Week**: 5 (All tutorials completed)

## Tank Description

This is an example tank showing the proper submission format. It demonstrates:

- Circular movement pattern
- Boundary checking and wall avoidance
- Distance-based power selection
- Random dodging when hit

## Strategy

**Movement**: Simple circular pattern with wall avoidance
**Targeting**: Direct fire at scanned enemies
**Power**: Adjusts based on distance (3 for close, 2 for medium, 1 for far)
**Defense**: Random dodge when hit

## Concepts Used

- Week 1: Basic tank structure
- Week 2: Angle calculation for targeting
- Week 3: Boundary checking
- Week 4: Random dodging
- Week 5: Distance-based power selection

## Expected Performance

Should beat:
- ✅ SittingDuck (easy)
- ✅ SpinBot (easy)
- ✅ WallsBot (maybe)

Will struggle against:
- ❌ TrackerBot (no prediction)
- ❌ ChampionBot (too simple)

## Future Improvements

1. Add predictive targeting
2. Implement hit probability calculation
3. Better movement patterns
4. Energy management
