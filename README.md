# Python Tank Wars - Learn Coding Through Battle! 🎮

Welcome to Python Tank Wars! This is a fun tutorial series designed to teach 8-year-olds (and anyone else!) how to code by building battle tanks that fight each other.

## What is This?

You'll learn Python programming by creating your own robot tank that can:
- Move around an arena
- Shoot at other tanks
- Dodge bullets
- Use math to aim better
- Make smart decisions

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.8 or newer
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Enthusiasm for robot battles!

### Installation

```bash
# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tutorial Structure

Follow these weekly tutorials in order:

### 📅 Week 1: GitHub Signup and My First Tank
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week1_MyFirstTank/`
- Create your GitHub account
- Learn what a tank program looks like
- Make your first tank move and shoot

### 📐 Week 2: Basic Trigonometry - Predicting Where Tanks Will Be
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week2_Trigonometry/`
- Learn about angles and directions
- Use math to predict where moving tanks will go
- Hit moving targets!

### ✅ Week 3: Checking Values - Stay Inside the Arena
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week3_BoundaryChecking/`
- Make sure your tank doesn't hit walls
- Check that you're aiming at valid targets
- Learn about if-statements and conditions

### 🎯 Week 4: Strategy - Unpredictable Movement
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week4_Strategy/`
- Make your tank move in tricky patterns
- React when someone shoots at you
- Learn to dodge!

### 🚀 Week 5: Advanced Targeting - Smart Shooting
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week5_AdvancedTargeting/`
- Choose how much power to use when shooting
- Predict if you'll hit before wasting a shot
- Become a tank master!

### 🏗️ Week 6: Advanced Python - Classes and Clean Code
**Location:** `Tutorials/Week6_AdvancedPython/`
- Learn to organize code like a professional
- Understand classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Create reusable components with the strategy pattern
- Build a modular tank architecture that's easy to modify and extend

## Sample Tanks

Check out `Samples/` for example tanks:
- **SittingDuck** - Doesn't move (easy to beat!)
- **SpinBot** - Spins in circles
- **Walls** - Drives around the edges
- **Tracker** - Follows other tanks
- **Sniper** - Advanced targeting and movement

## Guides

The `Guides/` folder has detailed explanations:
- **Python Basics** - Variables, functions, classes
- **Trigonometry for Tanks** - Angles, distance, prediction
- **Strategy Guide** - Movement patterns and tactics

## Submitting Your Tank

Put your tank in the `Submissions/YourName/` folder and create a Pull Request. Our automated system will:
1. Run your tank against sample opponents
2. Create a battle video
3. Generate a scoresheet showing how you did

## Rules

1. Have fun!
2. Help others learn
3. Be creative with your strategies
4. No peeking at other students' code before you try yourself
