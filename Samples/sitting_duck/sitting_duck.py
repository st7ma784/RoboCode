SittingDuck - The simplest tank possible

Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆ (Level 1)

This tank demonstrates:

- Comparing your shooting accuracy
- Your first opponent!

# ❌ Doesn't move (easy target)
# ❌ No dodging
# ❌ No aiming (shoots wherever radar happens to be)
# ❌ No strategy
# ✓ But it's simple to understand!
